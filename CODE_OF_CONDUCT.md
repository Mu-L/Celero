# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior in the Celero project. We value free and open discussion, trust contributors to act like adults, and do not enforce overly restrictive rules—just basic respect.

## Our Principles

1. **Be Respectful**
   Treat others with courtesy and consideration. Disagreement is fine; personal attacks are not.

2. **Communicate Clearly**
   Use straightforward language. If something isn't clear, ask for clarification rather than assume.

3. **Own Your Mistakes**
   If you make an error—code, doc, or communication—own it, apologize briefly if needed, and help fix it.

4. **Keep It Professional**
   Focus on the project. Off-topic banter is fine, but avoid harassment and personal insults.

5. **No Gatekeeping**
   Everyone should be able to participate. Help newcomers, share context, and don't assume prior knowledge.

## Scope

This Code applies to all interactions in:

* GitHub issues, pull requests, and reviews
* Project discussions (mailing lists, chat, forums)
* Presentations or any public events where Celero is represented

## Enforcement

If someone behaves in a way that violates these principles, maintainers may:

1. **Remind** them of this Code of Conduct.
2. **Moderate** comments or PRs (edit or hide).
3. **Ban** repeat offenders from contributing.

## Reporting Issues

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact the maintainers or open an issue tagged `code-of-conduct`.

## Attribution

This document is based on community best practices and adapted for Celero's culture of open, respectful collaboration.
